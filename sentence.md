# 万物与你

\```

I have met a thousand animals and seen a thousand wonderful things.

All this did without you.

This was my loss.

All this I want to do with you.

This will be my gain.

\```

我的一大遗憾是，没有你情况下，我见过很多的动物和很多美好的事物。而这一切是我想和你一起做的，这将会是我的收获.

# 我、生为女人

**I, Being Born a Woman**

\```

I, being born a woman and distressed. 

By all the needs and notions of my kind,

Am urged by your propinquity to find.

Your person fair, and feel a certain zest

To bear your body’s weight upon my breast:

So subtly is the fume of life designed,

To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,

And leave me once again undone, possessed.

Think not for this, however, the poor treason

Of my stout blood against my staggering brain,

I shall remember you with love, or season

My scorn with pity,—let me make it plain:

I find this frenzy insufficient reason

For conversation when we meet again.

\```

我，生为女人，且为我族类
所有的困厄和意向而苦恼，
因你的亲近，促使我发觉
你的美善，感觉有一股热望
想让你身体的重量压在我胸上。
生命的气动，其设计如此微妙，
既使心情明晰，又让理智昏暗，
让我再一次松懈防备，疯狂著迷。
然而，別以为这是我激烈的血液
对我犹豫的头脑，不幸的背叛；
我将怜惜地忆起你，或者以同情
调和我的轻蔑——让我明白地说：
我觉得这一时的狂放不足以成为
再度碰面时我们交谈的理由
